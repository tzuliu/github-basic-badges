Basic badges for using with GitHub, and a service that you can deploy and create your own service to serve the GitHub badges.

## Motivation

I know there are alots of services that you can generate badges for GitHub, i just developed one more to play around with Ruby and Heroku.

### Badges

All the URL Patterns showed in the table bellow must be used as `<app-url>\<url-pattern>`.

### Custom colors and text

You can customize the colors and the text of the badges, just use `color` and `text` parameters in the url, like customizing the last release example, check below:

[![GitHub Release Ex 1](https://github-basic-badges.herokuapp.com/release/kennedyoliveira/github-basic-badges.svg?color=blue&text=last--release)]()
[![GitHub Release Ex 2](https://github-basic-badges.herokuapp.com/release/kennedyoliveira/github-basic-badges.svg?color=orange)]()
[![GitHub Release Ex 3](https://github-basic-badges.herokuapp.com/release/kennedyoliveira/github-basic-badges.svg?text=final--release)]()
[![GitHub Release Ex 4](https://github-basic-badges.herokuapp.com/release/kennedyoliveira/github-basic-badges.svg?color=green)]()
[![GitHub Release Ex 5](https://github-basic-badges.herokuapp.com/release/kennedyoliveira/github-basic-badges.svg?color=yellow)]()
[![GitHub Release Ex 6](https://github-basic-badges.herokuapp.com/release/kennedyoliveira/github-basic-badges.svg?9900ff)]()

For colors you can use any hex colors you want, and some basic already defined, check the file [badge.rb](https://github.com/kennedyoliveira/github-basic-badges/blob/master/badges/badge.rb) for some basic colors.

# Push the code to heroku
git push heroku master

# Open the app
heroku open
````

### Mine Heroku App

My instance is running in the following url `https://github-basic-badges.herokuapp.com` you can use it to generate badges for your repos!
